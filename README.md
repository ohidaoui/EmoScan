3. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the collected data for analysis, including text normalization and removal of noise, this step includes writing style specific processing.

4. **Exploring various DL techniques** for polarity classification.

5. **Fine-tuning DarijaBERT-mix**, a pre-trained transformer-based model specifically designed for darija.

6. **Application Development**: Buiding a Demo *Streamlit* web application.
